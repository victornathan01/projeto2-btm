# Projeto 2 Pe na Estrada!

This is a Single Page React App for you to share to the web where you are going from and to and get people to share your ride to that destination.
Enjoy the benefit of knowing the type of vehicle, its capacity those rides, where from and to, and safety features of the trip.


# A complete CRUD project

Pe na Estrada uses a complete CRUD building method for its design and functionality: Create, Read, Update, Delete features.
These features will use and interact with a database, where the creation, changes and deletions will come and go from it.

# Technologies used and structure

The project uses Javascript, Html5, Css with Tailwind framework within Vite.

The website is nested in the App.jsx, containing a NavBar component and its routes to navigate within the pages that the project has, or also create a new listing on the NavBar link.
In the home, you will find all the Caronas listed, which you can click on them individually and navigate to its detail page, where you can sign up for that specific Carona.
As mentioned, the website is a complete CRUD, so you can also edit or delete that Carona, from that page.
